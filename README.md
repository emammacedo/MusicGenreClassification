# Music Genre Classification (Pattern Recognition)

The goal was to classify the genre of different musics based on features such as mean, variance, max and min. **Dataset** available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielopecs/gtzan-modified-music-genre-classification.

Two scenarios:
- **Binary Classification:** consider one-vs-all classification
- **Multiclass Classification:** consider the problem of classifying all genres together (10 classes)

Steps:
1. Data Splitting and Standardization
2. Feature Selection (Kruskal-Wallis, Correlation Matrix) and Reduction (PCA, LDA)
3. Classification (MDC, Bayes, Linear and Non-linear SVMs, KNN, among others)

A GUI was also developed.
